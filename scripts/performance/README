Various scripts to analyse performance. We used
- printing statements to determine timing of various steps 
- seff for determining memory requirements.

Scripts:
1. performance_inference.sh to analyse the effect of mode / disable_TTA / folds [1 or all folds]
2. timing_inference.sh to get better insights into the timing of the steps for scans of different sizes (small / medium / large)
3. inference_p16_batch0.sh to get a better view of how long single-threaded inference takes on the P16 data
