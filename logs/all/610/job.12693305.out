I am running the following nnUNet: 3d_fullres
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2.nnUNetTrainerV2'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:

use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, False)])
keep_only_largest_region None
min_region_size_per_class None

using model stored in  /exports/lkeb-hpc/smaijer/results/nnUNet/3d_fullres/Task610/nnUNetTrainerV2__nnUNetPlansv2.1
This model expects 1 input modalities for each image
Found 8 unique case ids, here are some examples: ['panc_00006' 'panc_00003' 'panc_00003' 'panc_00003' 'panc_00005'
 'panc_00001' 'panc_00000' 'panc_00004']
If they don't look right, make sure to double check your filenames. They must end with _0000.nii.gz etc
number of cases: 8
number of cases that still need to be predicted: 8
