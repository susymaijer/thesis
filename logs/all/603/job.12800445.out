using model stored in  /exports/lkeb-hpc/smaijer/results/nnUNet/3d_fullres/Task603/nnUNetTrainerV2__nnUNetPlansv2.1
This model expects 1 input modalities for each image
Found 16 unique case ids, here are some examples: ['panc_0507' 'panc_00003' 'panc_00004' 'panc_00002' 'panc_0591'
 'panc_0507' 'panc_00003' 'panc_00001' 'panc_00007' 'panc_00002']
If they don't look right, make sure to double check your filenames. They must end with _0000.nii.gz etc
number of cases: 16
number of cases that still need to be predicted: 16
