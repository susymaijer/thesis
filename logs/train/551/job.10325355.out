I am running the following nnUNet: 3d_fullres
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2.nnUNetTrainerV2'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:
num_classes:  1
modalities:  {0: 'CT'}
use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, False)])
keep_only_largest_region None
min_region_size_per_class None
min_size_per_class None
normalization_schemes OrderedDict([(0, 'CT')])
stages...

stage:  0
{'batch_size': 2, 'num_pool_per_axis': [4, 4, 5], 'patch_size': array([112, 112, 192]), 'median_patient_size_in_voxels': array([128, 113, 205]), 'current_spacing': array([1.      , 0.859375, 0.859375]), 'original_spacing': array([1.      , 0.859375, 0.859375]), 'do_dummy_2D_data_aug': False, 'pool_op_kernel_sizes': [[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 2]], 'conv_kernel_sizes': [[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]]}

I am using stage 0 from these plans
I am using sample dice + CE loss

I am using data from this folder:  /exports/lkeb-hpc/smaijer/data/nnUNet_preprocessed/Task551/nnUNetData_plans_v2.1

I am running the following nnUNet: 3d_fullres
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2.nnUNetTrainerV2'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:
num_classes:  1
modalities:  {0: 'CT'}
use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, False)])
keep_only_largest_region None
min_region_size_per_class None
min_size_per_class None
normalization_schemes OrderedDict([(0, 'CT')])
stages...

I am using stage 0 from these plans
I am using sample dice + CE loss

I am using data from this folder:  /exports/lkeb-hpc/smaijer/data/nnUNet_preprocessed/Task551/nnUNetData_plans_v2.1
