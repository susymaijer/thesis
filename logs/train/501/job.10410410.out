I am running the following nnUNet: 3d_fullres
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2.nnUNetTrainerV2'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:

use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, False)])
keep_only_largest_region None
min_region_size_per_class None
min_size_per_class None
normalization_schemes OrderedDict([(0, 'CT')])

I am using stage 1 from these plans
I am using batch dice + CE loss

I am using data from this folder:  /exports/lkeb-hpc/smaijer/data/nnUNet_preprocessed/Task501/nnUNetData_plans_v2.1
