I am running the following nnUNet: 3d_cascade_fullres
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2_CascadeFullRes.nnUNetTrainerV2CascadeFullRes'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:
num_classes:  1
modalities:  {0: 'CT'}
use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, False)])
keep_only_largest_region None
min_region_size_per_class None
min_size_per_class None
normalization_schemes OrderedDict([(0, 'CT')])

I am using stage 1 from these plans
I am using batch dice + CE loss
